This is a single-player chess game vs a bot using the StockFish API.

How to play:
1.	Choose a side.
2.	Click or start dragging a piece to see its legal moves.
3.	To move the piece, drag it to its destination.

When hovering over a cell with a legal move, the legal move marker will disappear. However, if the cell originally had a legal move marker, you can still place the piece there. Drop the piece on a cell without a legal move to make the markers appear again.

!!! If an error occurs, the game will be terminated, and you will have to start over. En Passant doesn't work with this API, so it isn't in the game!

Enjoy playing!
